# Agent 7: Parent Verification

This agent verifies parent shot images using Gemini 2.5 Pro's multimodal capabilities.
The verification prompts are constructed in agents/agent_7_parent_verification.py

The agent:
1. Loads generated parent shot image
2. Sends image + first_frame description to Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. Receives JSON verification response (approved/confidence/issues)
4. Retries up to 3 times if rejected
5. Soft failure mode: continues pipeline even if verification fails

Verification Prompt Pattern:
---
Analyze this generated image and verify it matches specifications.

EXPECTED FIRST FRAME: {first_frame}
EXPECTED CHARACTERS: {characters}
EXPECTED LOCATION: {location}

Verification Criteria:
1. COMPOSITION: Does image match description?
2. CHARACTERS: All present and visually correct?
3. LOCATION: Setting matches?
4. VISUAL QUALITY: Clear, well-lit, cinematic?
5. CONSISTENCY: No hallucinations or artifacts?

Respond with JSON:
{
  "approved": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "issues": ["list of issues"],
  "recommendation": "approve/regenerate/manual_review"
}
---

Soft Failure: Logs warnings but doesn't block pipeline.
